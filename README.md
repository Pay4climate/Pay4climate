- üëã Hi, we are @Pay4climate
- üå± We want to create a paytech solution dedicated to the carbon market

<!---
Pay4climate is a Pro-Climate Blockchain-Based Solution for Maximum Positive Impact
--->
We propose to banks or any PSP to collect a % on each client's transaction to contribute in the carbon removal markets. The client's contribution is converted into a stablecoin on Ripple via a fiat to crypto on-ramp solution. Then this amount is transferred to a client's dedicated smart contract that will purchase carbon dioxide removal (CDR) certificates on existing marketplaces such as XRPL's compatible Thallo's. This solution would require the creation of an SDK integrating the wallet and smart contract for automatic purchases. It would also allow connecting to some kind of launchpad for carbon removal ex-ante projects. On top of that, CDRs and/or hedge funds should be ‚Äúblockchainized‚Äù in order to integrate them into the system. Either they follow, or we will have to find projects that are already on a public blockchain.

A long-term perspective could be to work towards a DAO Funding where the funds collected from clients could be used in a DAO deployed by Pay4Climate and then managed by all clients via a voting process (DAOFunding = each client can vote the investment and management decisions). In practice, Pay4Climate's PSP clients would invest the contribution to a foundation that can be monitored by the contributors themselves.

Technical process: 1/ Fiat-to-Crypto conversion via a licensed partner 2/ Contributions are collected into a Smart Contract dedicated to the client 3/ API Connection to existing CDR marketplaces to gather the suppliers 4/ The Smart Contract automatically purchases CDRs on the marketplaces according to the client's preferences 5/ The client can showcase his contribution metrics (tons of carbon removed) via a Widget scraping the blockchain data.

More is yet to come...
